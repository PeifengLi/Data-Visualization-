# Clustering Analysis & Visualization on Fruit Consumption v.s. GDP per capita
## Topic Background & Objectives:
Fruits, a kind of food have low in calories and fat and are a source of natural sugars, fibers and vitamins. According to USDAâ€™s food pyramid and nutrition guidelines, fruits is one of the basic four food groups that people should include in their daily meals.

However, the unbalanced development of the world make some countries have the insufficient fruit supplement, which may lead to a serious of health problems in the residents like scurvy caused by lack of vitamin C or difficulty in maintaining a healthy body weight.

As we all known, most of fruits basically grow in the places that are hot and with plenty of sunshine. But typically the countries in these area are not fully developed, which causes the unbalanced production of the fruit - which means some developed countries may pay more to get enough fruit supplement from other export country.

This topic is focus on analyzing the the relationship between fruits consumptions and the GDP per capita. By using high dimension reduction methods like MDS and tSNE to show the dissimilarities between entities and clustering methods like KMeans, Spectral Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering, we may find out countries that project to have similar characteristics. The insight may help the organizations to improve the healthy diet across the world.
